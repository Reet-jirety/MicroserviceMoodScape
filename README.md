# Microservice MoodScape

Microservice MoodScape is a microservices-based application designed to analyze emotions using AI-powered emotion detection. The system includes various services such as authentication, user management, emotion analysis, and logging, orchestrated using Docker and Nginx.

## 🚀 Features
- **Microservices Architecture**: Decoupled services for authentication, emotion detection, user management, and logging.
- **AI-powered Emotion Detection**: Detect emotions using deep learning models.
- **Secure Authentication**: User authentication with JWT-based security.
- **Scalability**: Easily deployable and scalable using Docker and Nginx.
- **Logging & Monitoring**: Centralized logs for debugging and analysis.
